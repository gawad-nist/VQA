To be updated for VQA 2026 to take into account new run format submissions and revised scoring metric reporting.

# Task 1 (Answer Generation) Validator
Now available is a validator for task 1 (AG) runs. Just run the script validate.ag.run.py and pass the testing query json file and your run. It generates a report stating if the run passes or if there are errors that need to be fixed in your run.
NOTE: the validator index queries starting from 0, while the testing queries starts from Q_ID = 1. Please take this into consideration when debugging an error reported by the validator (e.g. you may need to skip to the next query to find the error)
